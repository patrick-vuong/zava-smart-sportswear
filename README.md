### Test Configuration

Tests are configured to run across multiple browsers and devices:
- **Desktop**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari
- **Mobile**: Mobile Chrome (Pixel 5), Mobile Safari (iPhone 12)

The test configuration automatically starts a development server before running tests and includes:
- Automatic screenshots on failure
- Video recording on retry
- Trace collection for debugging
- HTML reporting

### CI/CD Integration

Tests automatically run in GitHub Actions on:
- Push to `main` or `develop` branches
- Pull requests to `main` or `develop` branches

The CI pipeline:
1. Sets up Node.js environment
2. Installs dependencies
3. Installs Playwright browsers
4. Builds the application
5. Runs all tests
6. Uploads test reports as artifacts

### Writing New Tests

To add new tests:
1. Create a new `.spec.ts` file in the `tests/` directory
2. Follow the existing test patterns for consistency
3. Use descriptive test names and organize with `test.describe()`
4. Include proper assertions and error handling
5. Test both positive and negative scenarios

Example test structure:
```typescript
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test.describe('Feature Name', () => {
  test.beforeEach(async ({ page }) => {
    await page.goto('/');
    // Setup code
  });

  test('should do something specific', async ({ page }) => {
    // Test implementation
    await expect(page.locator('selector')).toBeVisible();
  });
});
```

### Debugging Tests

**Local debugging:**
```bash
npm run test:debug              # Step through tests
npm run test:headed            # See browser interactions
```

**CI debugging:**
- Check GitHub Actions logs
- Download test artifacts from failed runs
- Review screenshots and videos
