# Error Fix Instructions

## Current Error
```
Cannot find module '/workspaces/spark-template/node_modules/vite/dist/node/chunks/dep-CvfTChi5.js' 
imported from /workspaces/spark-template/node_modules/vite/dist/node/chunks/dep-DBxKXgDP.js
```

## Root Cause
The node_modules directory has corrupted Vite dependencies, likely due to:
1. Incomplete installation
2. Platform incompatibility issues (specifically with `function-bind@1.1.2` which expects macOS but is running on Linux)
3. Cache conflicts

## Solution

You need to manually clean and reinstall dependencies. Run these commands in your terminal:

### Option 1: Quick Fix (Recommended)
```bash
# Remove node_modules and package-lock.json
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json

# Clear npm cache
npm cache clean --force

# Reinstall dependencies
npm install
```

### Option 2: If Option 1 Fails
```bash
# Remove all build artifacts and caches
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json .vite

# Use legacy peer deps flag to avoid conflicts
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

### Option 3: Docker Container Restart
If the above options don't work, the Docker container may need to be rebuilt:
```bash
# Stop the current container
# Rebuild the container from scratch
# This will reinstall all system and npm dependencies
```

## Prevention

To avoid this issue in the future:
1. Always complete npm install operations without interruption
2. Don't manually delete files from node_modules
3. Use `npm ci` instead of `npm install` in CI/CD environments
4. Clear cache if you see module resolution errors

## Verification

After running the fix, verify it works:
```bash
npm run dev
```

You should see the Vite development server start without errors.

## Notes

The platform incompatibility warning about `function-bind@1.1.2` is a known issue and should not affect functionality in most cases. The package is a polyfill for older JavaScript environments and the warning can generally be ignored.
