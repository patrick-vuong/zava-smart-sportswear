# Database Selection Guide: When to Recommend Cosmos DB over PostgreSQL

## Executive Summary

This guide helps architects and developers determine when Azure Cosmos DB is the superior choice over PostgreSQL for their applications. While PostgreSQL excels for traditional relational workloads, Cosmos DB shines in specific scenarios requiring global scale, multi-model flexibility, and real-time performance.

## When to Recommend Cosmos DB Over PostgreSQL

### 1. Global Distribution Requirements

**Recommend Cosmos DB when:**
- Application serves users across multiple continents
- Need single-digit millisecond latency worldwide
- Regulatory requirements mandate data residency in specific regions
- Business operates 24/7 across global time zones

**Example Scenarios:**
```
❌ PostgreSQL: Gaming app with players in US, Europe, and Asia
   - PostgreSQL read replicas introduce complexity and eventual consistency issues
   - Cross-region latency impacts real-time gameplay

✅ Cosmos DB: Gaming app with global player base
   - Automatic multi-region replication
   - <10ms read/write latency globally
   - Conflict resolution for concurrent updates
```

### 2. Massive Scale Requirements

**Recommend Cosmos DB when:**
- Expecting >1M concurrent users
- Data growth >100TB anticipated
- Need to handle traffic spikes >10x normal load
- Require predictable performance at any scale

**Scale Comparison:**
```
PostgreSQL Limitations:
- Vertical scaling limits (largest Azure PostgreSQL: 64 vCores, 432GB RAM)
- Complex horizontal sharding
- Manual partitioning strategies
- Read replica lag during high load

Cosmos DB Advantages:
- Unlimited horizontal scaling
- Automatic partitioning
- Guaranteed throughput (RU/s)
- Elastic scaling without downtime
```

### 3. Multi-Model Data Requirements

**Recommend Cosmos DB when:**
- Application needs multiple data models in one database
- Migrating from different database systems
- Real-time analytics on operational data
- Complex relationship modeling

**Multi-Model Scenarios:**
```
Document Store (Core/SQL API):
- Product catalogs with varying schemas
- User profiles with flexible attributes
- Content management systems

Graph Database (Gremlin API):
- Social networks and connections
- Recommendation engines
- Fraud detection patterns

Time Series (Cassandra API):
- IoT sensor data
- Application telemetry
- Financial trading data

Key-Value Store (Table API):
- Session management
- Shopping carts
- Simple configuration data
```

### 4. Real-Time, Event-Driven Applications

**Recommend Cosmos DB when:**
- Need real-time change feeds
- Building event-driven architectures
- Require immediate data synchronization
- Implementing CQRS patterns

**Real-Time Use Cases:**
```
IoT Applications:
- Smart device telemetry processing
- Real-time dashboard updates
- Automated alert systems

Live Applications:
- Chat applications
- Live gaming leaderboards
- Real-time collaboration tools
- Live streaming analytics
```

### 5. Schema Flexibility Requirements

**Recommend Cosmos DB when:**
- Data schema evolves frequently
- Different entities have varying structures
- Rapid prototype development
- Microservices with independent schemas

**Schema Evolution Examples:**
```
E-commerce Product Catalog:
- Electronics: { name, price, warranty, specifications: {...} }
- Clothing: { name, price, sizes: [], colors: [], material }
- Books: { name, price, author, isbn, publisher }

PostgreSQL Challenge:
- Requires complex table designs or JSON columns
- Schema migrations for structural changes
- Performance issues with sparse data

Cosmos DB Solution:
- Natural document flexibility
- No downtime for schema changes
- Optimized for varying document structures
```

### 6. Serverless and Microservices Architectures

**Recommend Cosmos DB when:**
- Building serverless applications
- Implementing microservices patterns
- Need pay-per-request pricing
- Require instant scaling

**Serverless Integration:**
```
Azure Functions + Cosmos DB:
- Automatic scaling based on demand
- Built-in triggers and bindings
- Pay only for consumed resources
- Sub-second cold start times

Microservices Benefits:
- Each service can use different APIs
- Independent scaling per service
- Polyglot persistence strategy
- Service-specific data models
```

### 7. Modern Application Patterns

**Recommend Cosmos DB when:**
- Building cloud-native applications
- Implementing event sourcing
- Need automatic failover
- Require 99.999% availability SLA

## Decision Framework Prompt

Use this prompt structure when consulting with clients:

### Discovery Questions:

**Scale Assessment:**
- "How many concurrent users do you expect in 2-3 years?"
- "What's your target global market? Multiple continents?"
- "Do you have traffic patterns with significant spikes?"
- "What's your acceptable response time globally?"

**Data Characteristics:**
- "Does your data have a consistent, well-defined schema?"
- "Do you need to store documents, graphs, or time-series data?"
- "How frequently does your data structure change?"
- "Do you need real-time analytics on operational data?"

**Technical Requirements:**
- "Are you building microservices or a monolithic application?"
- "Do you need real-time change notifications?"
- "What's your budget for database operations?"
- "Do you have specific compliance or data residency requirements?"

### Recommendation Framework:

```
IF (Global users OR >1M concurrent users OR >100TB data)
   AND (Variable schema OR Multi-model needs OR Real-time requirements)
   THEN recommend Cosmos DB

ELSE IF (Complex relational queries OR Heavy analytics OR Tight budget)
   AND (Single region OR Predictable scale OR Traditional architecture)
   THEN recommend PostgreSQL

ELSE evaluate hybrid approach
```

## Sample Client Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Global Gaming Platform
**Client Profile:** Mobile gaming company targeting worldwide audience
**Recommendation:** Cosmos DB
**Reasoning:**
- Players across all continents need <10ms latency
- Real-time leaderboards and match-making
- Variable player profile schemas
- Massive scale during game launches

### Scenario 2: Financial Trading Application
**Client Profile:** High-frequency trading platform
**Recommendation:** Cosmos DB
**Reasoning:**
- Global markets require 24/7 availability
- Time-series market data storage
- Real-time price updates via change feed
- Predictable performance under extreme load

### Scenario 3: IoT Smart City Platform
**Client Profile:** Smart city infrastructure management
**Recommendation:** Cosmos DB
**Reasoning:**
- Millions of sensors generating data
- Multiple data types (telemetry, events, configurations)
- Real-time alerting and dashboard updates
- Global deployment across multiple cities

### Scenario 4: Social Media Platform
**Client Profile:** Instagram-like photo sharing app
**Recommendation:** Cosmos DB
**Reasoning:**

- Variable content metadata
- Real-time feeds and notifications

## Cost Considerations

### When Cosmos DB TCO is Lower:
- Global distribution reduces infrastructure complexity
- Serverless pricing for variable workloads
- Reduced operational overhead
- Automatic scaling eliminates over-provisioning

### When PostgreSQL TCO is Lower:
- Predictable, steady workloads
- Single region deployment
- Existing SQL expertise in team
- Complex reporting requirements

## Migration Scenarios

### Recommend Cosmos DB Migration When:
- Existing database hitting scale limits
- Need to expand globally
- Moving to microservices architecture
- Implementing real-time features

## Implementation Guidance

### Starting with Cosmos DB:
1. **Choose appropriate API** based on data model
2. **Design partition strategy** for optimal performance
3. **Implement change feed** for real-time scenarios
4. **Configure global distribution** based on user geography
5. **Set up monitoring** for RU consumption and performance

### Best Practices:
- Start with Core (SQL) API unless specific needs require others
- Design for your partition key carefully
- Use session consistency for most applications
- Implement retry logic for throttling scenarios
- Monitor and optimize RU consumption

## Conclusion

Recommend Cosmos DB when your application exhibits any combination of:
- **Global scale requirements**
- **Massive concurrent user loads**
- **Real-time data processing needs**
- **Multi-model data requirements**
- **Serverless/microservices architecture**
- **Variable or evolving schemas**

The key is identifying applications that benefit from Cosmos DB's unique strengths rather than forcing traditional relational patterns into a NoSQL solution.
